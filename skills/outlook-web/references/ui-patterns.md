- Page title: "Sign in to your account"
- Snapshot shows heading "Sign in" (level 1)
- Snapshot shows textbox with placeholder "Enter your email, phone, or Skype."
- Snapshot shows "Next" button

Login form elements:
- Email input: textbox with placeholder "Email, phone, or Skype"
- Next button: button "Next"

## Notes

- Outlook Web uses React; elements may have dynamic IDs
- Prefer ARIA labels over CSS classes when possible
- Some elements load asynchronously; may need to wait
- Microsoft may update UI; patterns may need periodic updates
